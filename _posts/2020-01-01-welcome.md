## Welcome

If you haven't visited my bio page, I'm currently a Master's student in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University. My research focuses on developing methods for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning.

I've started this blog to write about my research journey, personal projects and other data-related stories that intrigue me.

Stay tuned.
