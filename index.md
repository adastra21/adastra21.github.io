I am a Data Scientist interested in solving problems at the intersection of privacy, fairness and machine learning. 

I recently graduated with a MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science from Duke University. My graduate research focused on using reweighing to de-bias real-world datasets.

Before Duke, I worked in the tech industry for over 5 years in different roles spanning business intelligence, analytics implementation and data science.

My career objective is to develop machine learning methods that preserve privacy and ensure fairness.
