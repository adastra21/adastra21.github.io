My mission is to help startups scale with the use of data science.

I am a Data Scientist with 6 years of experience in business intelligence, analytics implementation and data science in leading technology companies in the US and Pakistan. Most recently, I led demand forecasting for a quick commerce startup in Lahore, Pakistan.

I have a MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science from Duke University, and BS in Mathematical Economics from Gettysburg College.
