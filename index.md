## Responsible Data Scientist

I am currently a Master’s student in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke Univerity graduating in May 2021. My research focuses on developing methods for detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning.

I have worked for 5 years in different analytics roles in data science, business intelligence and analytics implementation. My career highlight is developing Jet.com’s competitive advantage in analytics after its acquisition by Walmart for $3.3B in 2016.

I am passionable about building fair algorithms in fintech, real estate and e-commerce.
