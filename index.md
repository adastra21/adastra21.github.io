I am a Responsible Data Scientist and use fair machine learning to solve complex business problems. In particular, I am interested in building algorithms that respect user privacy and autonomy and produce fair outcomes.

My graduate research focused on using preprocessing techniques to de-bias datasets. I found that reweighing is a simple yet powerful technique that can mitigate bias with respect to multiple sensitive attributes.

Previously, I worked for 5 years in the technology industry in data science, business intelligence and analytics implementation. My career highlight is developing Jet.comâ€™s competitive advantage in analytics after its acquisition by Walmart for $3.3B in 2016.

I graduated with a MS in Interdisciplinary Data Science from Duke University.
